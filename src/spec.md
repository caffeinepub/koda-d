# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add clear contact options, remove the caffeine.ai attribution, and enhance the homepage content to feel more credible and detailed for an influencer marketing agency.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a dedicated Contact section (with id="contact") that is reachable from a new “Contact” item in the header navigation (desktop + mobile) and uses the existing smooth-scroll behavior.
- Display the exact contact details in the Contact section: email (mailto:dkoda911@gmail.com) and WhatsApp (+1 626-875-4603 via wa.me link).
- Remove the “Built with … using caffeine.ai” attribution from the footer and adjust spacing/layout so the footer remains visually balanced.
- Update the footer “Get in Touch” area to include clickable email and WhatsApp links (dkoda911@gmail.com, +1 626-875-4603) and ensure footer copy doesn’t imply forms are the only contact method.
- Enhance existing marketing sections with additional credibility content in English (without removing “How It Works”, “What We Offer”, or the application forms), including: clearer services breakdown (brands vs creators), a more detailed process/timeline, social proof placeholders (no real brands/numbers), and an FAQ section.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can navigate to a new Contact section from the header, see and click email/WhatsApp contact links in both the Contact section and the footer, no longer see any caffeine.ai attribution, and read more detailed/credible agency content (including new credibility-oriented sections like an FAQ) while existing application forms remain available.

  "summary": "REQ-9, REQ-12 appear implemented via a new Contact section (with correct mailto/wa.me links) and updated footer contact links, plus header navigation includes a Contact item with smooth scroll. REQ-10 appears implemented in the footer by removing caffeine.ai attribution (no such text shown in the modified footer). REQ-11 adds new credibility sections (services breakdown, process timeline, social proof, FAQ), but the Social Proof content includes potentially unverifiable performance-like claims and concrete numerical stats, which conflicts with the requirement to avoid unverifiable claims/numbers unless provided by the user.",

      "reason": "The new Social Proof section includes specific large numeric stats (e.g., 500+/200+/1000+) and testimonial language implying results/ROI, which are performance-number-like claims not provided by the user (even if labeled illustrative).",
